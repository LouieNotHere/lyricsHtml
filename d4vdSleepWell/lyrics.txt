Do you think about me every night
Before you go to sleep?
I know you must be terrified
Of what you might see in your dreams, but

I'm here for you still
And even if you don't think that I'm near
I'll still be right next to you, my dear
And the way you make me feel
Has the power to make the whole world stand still
Who's to say that our love ain't real?

And I know I'm not the perfect guy
But, I think I'm doing just alright
It doesn't matter what you thought of me then
But what you think of me now
We haven't always seen eye to eye
But right now, won't you look at mine?
Don't be scared, there's no such thing as fear
When you sleep, just know that

I'm here for you still
And even if you don't think that I'm near
I'll still be right next to you, my dear
And the way you make me feel
Has the power to make the whole world stand still
Who's to say that our love ain't real?
